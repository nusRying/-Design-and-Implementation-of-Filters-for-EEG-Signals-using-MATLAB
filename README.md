# -Design-and-Implementation-of-Filters-for-EEG-Signals-using-MATLAB
Objective: Improved EEG signal quality by applying various digital filters (notch, high pass, low pass, band pass) using MATLAB.  Techniques: Identified and removed 50Hz/60Hz line noise using notch filters and used FFT for signal validation.  Outcome: Enhanced EEG signal clarity, enabling more accurate neurological analysis and interpretation.
